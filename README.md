## Data Science Capstone Project â€“ Rental Growth Analysis

This capstone project was part of my undergraduate Data Science degree at Arizona State University. My focus was on identifying the **key factors driving rental price growth in U.S. cities before and after the COVID-19 pandemic**.

## My Contributions
- Conducted EDA and hypothesis-driven analysis on **2.6 million rows** of Zillow rental data (sourced via HuggingFace)
- Engineered new features to capture **rental volatility** and **growth trends over time**
- Applied **multivariate linear regression** to estimate feature impact on rental growth
- Used **KMeans clustering** to segment cities by growth profiles
- Discovered that **housing density**, **population levels**, and **COVID stringency policies** were the strongest predictors of post-COVID rental increases
